We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around,
(Yeah) Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson,
Look out Jackson town
Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health (Hmm)
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself,
Yeah yeah, go to Jackson, but go comb that hair!
I'm gonna snowball Jackson
Go ahaid and see if I care.
When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (Ha ha ha)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how,
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cos I'm goin' to Jackson
"Goodbye, " that's all she wrote
They'll laugh at you in Jackson (I doubt it), and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you down that town like a scalded hound,
With your tail tucked between your legs,
Yeah yeah yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' there in Jackson, behind my Jaypan Plan,
We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I go to Jackson, and that's a natural fact
We're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back
We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out.
