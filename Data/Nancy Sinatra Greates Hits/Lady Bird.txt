I've been where the eagle flies
Rode his wings 'cross autumn skies
Kissed the sun, touched the moon
But he left me much too soon
His lady bird
He left his lady bird
Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would
You lady bird
Pretty lady bird
Lightning flashed across the sky
The night he taught me how to fly
The sun came up and then I found
Too soon he let his lady down
His lady bird
I'm his lady bird
Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would
You lady bird
Pretty lady bird
Winter lives in my heart
In the times we're apart
Summer sings a song or two
When he says "I love you true"
My lady bird
Yeah, I'm his lady bird
Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would
You lady bird
Pretty lady bird (I'm your lady bird)
You're a lady bird (Yes, I'm a lady bird)
You're too much you little bird
