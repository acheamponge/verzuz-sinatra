I've told you that I'm lightning's girl
But you keep hanging 'round
If lightning ever catches you
He's got to put you down
About six feet
Stay away from lightning's girl
And this part of town
Stay away from lightning's girl
Or he'll put you down
Yeah
Better stop your grooving 'round
Another rooster's hen
If lightning ever catches you
He's got to do you in
In about two minutes
Stay away from lightning's girl
And this part of town
Stay away from lightning's girl
Or he'll put you down
Here comes lightning down the street
While you just stand there talking
If I were you I'd start to move
And tell my story walking
About a hundred miles an hour
Stay away from lightning's girl
And this part of town
Stay away from lightning's girl
Or he'll put you down
Hmmmm
Stay away from lightning's girl
Stay away from lightning's girl
Stay away from lightning's girl
Stay away from lightning's girl
