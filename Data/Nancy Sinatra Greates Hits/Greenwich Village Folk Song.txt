I met him in a Greenwich village coffee nook
He was selling folk songs and little bitty books
The place was full of happy hop'd up hippies at the time
All mornin' long he hadn't made a dime
He was a Greenwich village folk song salesman
You should have heard the bag he was in
He was a Greenwich village folk song salesman
He'd jump up and sing one now and then
Said I've got songs about Detroit and VietNam
And new one about the economic opportunity program
He had a little banjo with an alligator strap
He'd sing a song at the drop of your hat
He had one song there that Johnson should have heard
To the tune of the Great Speckled Bird
He was a Greenwich village folk song salesman
His berd was a dark shade of green
He was a Greenwich village folk song salesman
And now and then he'd jump up and he screams
Said I've got songs about Detroit and Vietnam
And new one about the economic opportunity program
I can't even pronounce that!
Well I told him I had to soon be on my way
Way back to Music City US of A
He said if you'd see Lee and Nancy my friend
Tell 'em I've got fifteen songs for them
He was a Greenwich village folk song salesman...
