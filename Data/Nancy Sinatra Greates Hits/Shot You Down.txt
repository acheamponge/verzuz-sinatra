I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
My baby shot me down
My baby shot me down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Down, down, d-down
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
