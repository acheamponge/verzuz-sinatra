You've got your world and I've got mine
And it's a shame
Two grown-up worlds
That will never be the same
Why can't we be like storybook children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow
Why can't we be like storybook children?
In a wonderland where nothing is planned for tomorrow
You've got his ring, you've got his heart
You've got it, baby
And it's too late to turn away and start again
Why can't we be like storybook children?
Running through the rain, hand in hand, across the meadow
Why can't we be like storybook children?
In a wonderland where nothing is planned for tomorrow
How happy we could be
If only we were storybook children
Storybook children
Storybook children
Storybook children
Storybook children
