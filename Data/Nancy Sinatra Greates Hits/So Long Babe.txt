I know you're leavin' babe,
Goodbye, so long.
I hope someday somebody
Listens to your song.
Those bright lights never ever
Spell your name it's true.
Maybe a change of scene
Will be the best for you.
So long babe, so long babe,
So long babe, so long babe
So long babe
I know you're leavin' babe,
Goodbye, so long.
Pick up the pieces
And go back where you belong.
You gave them all you had
And what did they give you?
Well they gave you nothin' babe
So give 'em nothin' too.
So long babe, so long babe, so long babe
So long babe, so long babe, so long babe,
So long babe.
I know you're leavin' babe,
Goodbye and so long.
You never made it babe,
I wonder what went wrong.
They never understood your songs,
Here's what you do
Just walk away and leave 'em,
And let 'em come to you.
So long babe, so long babe,
Yeah so long babe, so long babe
So long babe, so long babe,
So long babe
So long babe,
Ah so long babe
So long babe
Mmm So long babe
