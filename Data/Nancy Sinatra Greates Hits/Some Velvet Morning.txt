Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight

Flowers growing on a hill, dragonflies and daffodils
Learn from us very much, look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name

Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight

Flowers are the things we know, secrets are the things we grow
Learn from us very much, look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name
 Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
 Flowers growing on a hill
 I'm gonna open up your gate
 dragonflies and daffodils
 And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
 Learn from us very much
 And how she gave me life
 look at us but do not touch

And how she made it end
