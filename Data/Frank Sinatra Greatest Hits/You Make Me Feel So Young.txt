You make me feel so young
You make me feel so Spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I want to go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I
Are just like a couple of tots
Running across a meadow
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I want to go and play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I
Are just like a couple of tots
Running across a meadow
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
Wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm going to feel the way I do today
'Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh, you make me feel so young
