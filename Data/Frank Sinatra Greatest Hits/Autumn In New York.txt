Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel, I'm home
It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
