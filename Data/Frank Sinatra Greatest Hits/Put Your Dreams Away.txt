Put your dreams away for another day
And I will take their place in your heart
Wishing on a star never got you far
And so it's time to make a new start
When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you
Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling
And put all your dreams away
When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you
Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling
And put all your dreams away
