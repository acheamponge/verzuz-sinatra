It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place
Except you and me
So, set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story you oughta know
We're drinkin', my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I got the routine
So drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad
Wish you'd make the music pretty and sad
Could tell you a lot
But you've got to be true to your code
So, make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy
You simply gotta listen to me
'Til it's all talked away
Well that's how it goes
And Joe, I know your gettin' pretty anxious to close
So, thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear
This torch that I found
Must be drowned
Or it soon might explode
So, make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
That long, long road
