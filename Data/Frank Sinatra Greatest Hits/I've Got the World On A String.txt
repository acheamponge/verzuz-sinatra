I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go
I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
Man this is the life
And now I'm so in love!
