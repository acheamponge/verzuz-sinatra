I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
I never cared much
Oh, look at me now!
I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
Never knew much
Oh, look at me now!
I'm a new man better than Casanova at his best
With a new heart and a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest
So I'm the guy who turned out a lover
So I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Oh, look at me now!
I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
I never cared much
Oh, look at me now!
And I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get form your touch
I never knew much
Oh, look at me now!
I'm a new man better than casanova at his very best
With a new heart and a brand new start
And I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest
So I'm the guy who turned out a lover
Yes I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Oh, look at me now!
Look at me now!
