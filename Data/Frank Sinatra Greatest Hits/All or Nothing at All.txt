All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all
All or nothing at all
If it's love, there ain't no in between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been?
No, I'd rather, rather have nothing at all
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't you smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart, it may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, I'd be caught in the undertow
So you see, I have got to say no, no
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
Nothing at all
There ain't nothing at all
Nothing at all
