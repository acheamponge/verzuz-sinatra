It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars, guitars
Lips, red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
And without thinking twice
I left her and I threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, how it longs for the sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey
