It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but, ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancies, and in time may go
But oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're goin' a long, long way
In time, The Rockies may crumble, Gibralter may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancy's anytime they go
But oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're goin' a long, long way
In time, The Rockies may crumble, Gibralter may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love, our love is here to stay
