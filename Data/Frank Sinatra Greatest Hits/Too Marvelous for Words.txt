You're just to marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That says enough, tell enough
I mean they just aren't swell enough
You're much, too much, and just too very very
To ever be in Webster's dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words
You're much, you're too much
And just too very very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
To tell you that you're marvelous
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words
