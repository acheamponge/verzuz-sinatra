All the boys are buzzing since I introduced my cousin Louella,
Count them by the dozen as they swarm around my cousin Louella.
The way they sigh when she walks by, you'd think she was a movie queen.
They never saw such charm before, not even on a movie screen.
Like the bees a-buzzing for some honey from my cousin Louella,
Everyone's supposin' he'd be chosen as the fortunate fellow,
But will they shout when they find out my cousin will be leaving soon.
Louella only came to town to get herself a pretty gown for her honeymoon.
