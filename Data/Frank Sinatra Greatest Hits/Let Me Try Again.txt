I know I said that I was leaving
But I just, couldn't say goodbye
It was only self deceiving
To walk away from someone,
Who means everything in life to you
You learn from every lonley day
I've learned and I've come back to stay
Let me try again
Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all,
You and I again
Just forgive me,
Or I'll die
Please let me try again
I was such a fool to doubt you
To try and go it all alone,
There's no sense to life without you,
Now all I do is just exist
And think about the chance I've missed
To beg is not an easy task
But pride is such a foolish mask
Let me try again
Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all,
You and I again
Just forgive me,
Or I'll die
Please let me try again
