Kiss me once
Then, kiss me twice
Then, kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know
How many dreams I dream about you
Or just how empty they all seem without you
So, kiss me once
Then, kiss me twice
Kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
