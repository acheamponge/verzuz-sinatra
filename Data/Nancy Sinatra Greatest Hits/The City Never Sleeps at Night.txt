Old man, young men
Preachers saying: "Amen"
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come...
The city never sleeps at night?
Red cars, blue cars
Payment overdue cars
Cops with indigestion
Millionaires and sun bums
How come...
The city never sleeps at night?
The city never sleeps at night?
Short girls, tall girls
Happy that they are all girls
Walkin' into nights love
Holding hands and then some
How come...
The city never sleeps at night?
Good guys, bad guys
Grin and face and show guys
Losers with their hands out
Kitchens baking breadcrumbs
How come...
The city never sleeps at night?
The city never sleeps at night?
Long nights, short nights
Big hello's and goodnights
Dreams and conversations
Not a single ho-hum
How come...
The city never sleeps at night?
Old man, young men
Preachers saying: "Amen"
Taking up collection
Playing on a bass drum
How come...
The city never sleeps at night?
