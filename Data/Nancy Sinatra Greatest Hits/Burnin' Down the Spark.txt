Standing in the crowds
Lost out in the street
Loving the chaos
With my heart down at my feet
Taking every step like it's my very last
Looking round the corners
Searching through the glass
For a glimpse of you
Eyes of shining blue
All these memories of you come to haunt me
They come to haunt me
Taste the stinging rain
Falling on my tongue
Hanging on your words
Cherish every one
Can't bring you back no matter what I say
Driving in my car just to drive away
Hear the tires spin
Round and round again
All these memories still come to haunt me
They come to haunt me
The city sleepin' cross the river
I'm up alone burning down the spark
Well I wonder where you are tonight
And how far you drifted out there, out there in the dark
Wind at my window
Rattling the door
Pounding on my heart
Like it's never done before
Still I wonder if it could be these memories
No matter how I try they never let me be
Always find a way
Calling out your name
All these memories of you stay and haunt me
Mmh come to haunt me
Mmh they still haunt me
Oh they come and haunt me
