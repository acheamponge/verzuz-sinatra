There's a man who always stood right by me
Tall and proud and good when times were bad
To much heart, is the only fault that I see
This song's not for you folks
It's for my dad
Always a partner, a playmate and a teacher
Ready with a joke when times were sad
And in my teens, sometimes he was a preacher
This song's not for you folks
It's for my dad
He always was a rock when I needed one
He gave me good advice when I needed some
I want you to know that when It's said and done
He's one of the best friends I ever had... I ever had
This song's not for you folks
It's for my dad
He always was a rock when I needed one
He gave me good advice when I needed some
I want you to know that when it's said and done
He's one of the best friends I ever had... oh, I ever had
This song's not for you folks
It's for my dad
Of course I like you folks
But I love my dad
