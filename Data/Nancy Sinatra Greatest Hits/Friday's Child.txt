Friday's child hard luck is her brother
(Friday's child) Friday's child her sister's misery
Friday's child her daddy they call hard times
Friday's child that's me
(Friday's child) Friday's child born a little ugly
(Friday's child) Friday's child good looks passed her by
Friday's child makes something look like nothing
Friday's child am I, yeah
(Friday's child)
(Friday's child)
(Friday's child)
Friday's child never climbed no mountain
(Friday's child) Friday's child she ain't even gonna try
Friday's child whom they'll forget to bury
Friday's child am I
(Friday's child)
(Friday's child)
(Friday's child)
