God knows I love you
God knows I do
I remember when we were children playing in the fields
I loved you truely even then and you know I always will
Climbin' over creek banks down by the cotton gin
Chasin' papa's billy goat tearin' my petticoat you cried when I got a whippin'
You cried when my puppy died just because I cried
And I've heard you laugh when in my heart
I knew you wanted to cry
And when the truth might have hurt me
I've heard you tell a lie
And that is why I love you like I do
God knows I love you
God knows I do
Now I carry sweet and gentle your first baby child
I live within the bright anticipation of your smile
Even in the bad times, seems like you never gave in
Standin' behind me and fightin' for me blindly and cryin' when I get a whippin'
You cried when my puppy died just because I cried
And I've heard you laugh when in my heart
I knew you wanted to cry
And when the truth might have hurt me
I've heard you tell a lie
And that is why I love you like I do
God knows I love you
God knows I do
