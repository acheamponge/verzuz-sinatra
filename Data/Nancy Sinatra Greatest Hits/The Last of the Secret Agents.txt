He's never caught one spy I'm told
He's never even caught a cold
Got his degree from Disney Land
But he's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man
He's an underwhelming kind of sleuth
He thinks James Bond's some kind of suit
He's further back than an "also ran"
But he's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man
He'd come in third in a two-horse race
I've never had to slap his face
(What a shame)
But people try to understand
He's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man
He's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man
He's the last of the secret agents
And he's my man
