Love eyes
Baby, you sure got
Love eyes
Turn me on a lot
My world lies right there in your love eyes, your love eyes
Love eyes
Keep me all uptight
Love eyes
Make me do what's right
My world lies right there in your love eyes, your love eyes
You know I know you know everything I do
'Cause everything I do, you know, I do it just for you
Take me in your arms, make me realize
All I'll ever need is in your...
Love eyes
Nothing else will do
Love eyes
Yeah, they keep my loving true
My world lies right there in your...
Love eyes
Baby, you sure got
Love eyes
Man, they turn me on a lot
My world lies right there in your love eyes, your love eyes
