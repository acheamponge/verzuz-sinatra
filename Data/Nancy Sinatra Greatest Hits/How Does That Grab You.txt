You came by at two o'clock
You shoulda been by at ten
I said bye at three o'clock
And I ain't coming back again, whoa
How does that grab you, darlin'?
How does that mess your mind?
How does that grab you darlin'?
This girl is leavin' you behind
You smart alec tom cat, you
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
I'm gonna go out and prowl, yeah
Don't come a-lookin' for your pussycat
'Cause I won't be here no how, whoa
How does that grab you darlin'?
How does that mess your mind?
How does that grab you darlin'?
This girl is leavin' you behind
Now you ain't nothin' but an old tomcat
Runnin' around my house
I'll tell you something, you old tomcat
You just lost your mouse, whoa
How does that grab you darlin'?
How does that mess your mind?
How does that grab you darlin'?
This girl is leavin' you behind
There's more than one way to skin a cat you know, rraow
Bye-bye
