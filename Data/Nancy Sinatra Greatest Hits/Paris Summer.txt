Walking down some cobbled street
the sound of water near my feet
I found her
A hundred thousand flashes in my mind and soon my arms were all around her
We lay and let our hearts take wings and fly across the scene
Love came pouring from the sky pretending it was rain
Oo-oh Paris Summer

Standing on some cobbled street
the sound of water near my feet
He found me
I took the wedding ring off of my hand before he put his arms around me
I lived my lie and dreamed his dreams and laid beside the scene
When I left the tears I cried he thought were just the rain
Oo-oh Paris Summer
 Walking down some cobbled street, the sound of water near my feet
 I found her
 I took the wedding ring off of my hand
 Before I put my arms around her
We lay and let our hearts take wings
 And fly across the scene
 When she left the tears she cried
 He thought were just the rain
 Oo-oh Paris Summer
 Whooo-oa Paris Summer
