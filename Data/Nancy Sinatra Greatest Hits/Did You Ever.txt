Did you ever?
Not so much that you could notice
Well, could you estimate how many?
Eight or nine
Will you do it anymore?
As soon as you walk out the door
Well, I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time
Could I fix you once more?
No thanks, I just had one
Then how about a nice big?
That would be just fine
Is there any special way?
Oh no, whatever you say
Well, I just wondered, have you ever?
All the time
Does he look like?
No, he's taller and more handsome
Yeah, but is he old?
Oh no, he's young and he's in his prime
Does your father know? I'll bet
Mm-mm, I haven't told him yet
I just wondered, do you ever?
All the time
But just for old times sake
No, that would be much harder
Oh, then how about?
Well, are you sure you don't mind?
Hey, I know just the thing for us
No, I'm afraid I'll miss my bus
Well, I just wondered, have you ever?
All the time
I just wondered, did you ever?
All the time
