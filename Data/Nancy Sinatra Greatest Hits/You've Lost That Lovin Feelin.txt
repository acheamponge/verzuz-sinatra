You never close your eyes, anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it, but baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin, whoa that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Now there's no welcome look, in your eyes when I reach, for you
And you're starting to criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying, cause baby, something beautiful's dying

You've lost that lovin' feelin, whoa that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin now it's gone, gone, gone
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only, love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I beg you please, please, please, please
I need your love, need your love, I need your love, need your love
So bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back

Bring back, that lovin' feelin', whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin', cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa, whoa, whoa
