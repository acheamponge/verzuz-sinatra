There's no one in this world for me
There's never gonna be
There's no one in this world needs me
There's never gonna be
And yet sometimes in my dreams I hear
Sundown, I miss you sundown
Sundown, I need you sundown
Come on, come on, come on, come on back to me
Come on, come on, come on, come on back to me
I need you sundown, I need you sundown
There's no hands ever reached for me
There's never gonna be
There's no one meant for lonely me
There's never gonna be
And yet sometimes in my dreams I hear
Sundown, I miss you sundown
Sundown, I want you sundown
Come on, come on, come on, come on back to me
Come on, come on, come on, come on back to me
I love you sundown
I love you sundown
I love you sundown
